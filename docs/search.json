That means designing and delivering lots of R training, from absolute beginners to advanced work, training on Microsoft’s data-ish tools, especially Power BI, PowerQuery, and Excel (the cement of the public-sector universe), and (increasingly), lots of specialist non-technical training about AI/ML, data literacy, and data viz. I also am involved in national initiatives about digital and data careers.\n\n\n\nI’ve always been interested in tech, but professionally I initially trained in medicine and philosophy. I’ve spent the bulk of my professional life so far university teaching and working on a research programme about evidence and causation in health.\nAfter a happy decade or so of work in UCL STS, I decided to take a bit of time away from academic work to support a family relocation to the North Highlands. Ironically, my planned “quiet career break year” was 2019, and so the laziness, reflection, and family life that I’d been after turned into “really intensive COVID response work”. That had the happy side-effect of confronting me with a lot of interesting data science person, and kindling a passion for doing health tech better in a way that serves the needs of the people of Scotland.\nA personal view: health tech still serves the interests of tech companies first, and the needs of the population last. That’s the wrong way round, and we desperately need data science experts who can challenge that injustice.\n\n\n\n\nMB BS medicine, UCL, 2007\nPhD in philosophy of medicine, UCL, 2011\npostgraduate certificates in biomedical ethics, information governance, and teaching for HE/FE\n\n\n\nFluent R, Power BI, Excel/PowerQuery, with useful subsidiary skills in Tableau, Python, SQL\nHighly experienced teacher at all levels between secondary school and post-doctoral, with a particular interest in designing and delivering training that’s strongly adapted to meet the needs of the health and care workforce.\nExperienced public engagement, including writing, media, and (horrifyingly) standup\nAcademic research with 20+ major academic outputs - see non-current ORCID"
